Each build stage will result in a tangible, end-to-end feature that you can test on your front-end. I will define the **Goal** for each build, the **Components to Build/Refactor**, and the specific **End-to-End Test** you can perform.

---

### **Build 1: The Core Conversation & Orchestration Loop**

This first build focuses on establishing the absolute core of the system: the `Ultra Orchestrator Agent` and its ability to manage a basic conversation within a stateful graph.

*   **Goal**: Create a persistent, stateful conversational agent that can handle user input, maintain conversation history, and respond. This validates the foundational `Orchestrator Graph` and state management.

*   **Components to Build/Refactor**:
    1.  **Ultra Orchestrator Agent (Initial Version)**:
        *   Refactor your existing agent logic to act as the primary node in the graph.
        *   Implement basic **Conversation Management**: It should be able to receive input and use an LLM to generate a response.
    2.  **LLM Integration (Single Model)**:
        *   Connect to one primary LLM API (e.g., **Groq API with Llama 3.1**) for fast, initial responses. We'll add fallbacks later.
    3.  **Orchestrator Graph (Simple)**:
        *   Create the main `LangGraph` instance.
        *   Define a simple state object that includes `conversation_history` (a list of messages).
        *   The graph will have two nodes: `get_user_input` and `call_orchestrator`. It will simply loop, passing the growing history back to the orchestrator.
    4.  **Short-Term Memory (Basic)**:
        *   The `conversation_history` in the graph's state *is* the initial short-term memory. It ensures the agent remembers the last thing said.

*   **End-to-End Test**:
    *   **Action**: On the front-end, send a series of simple messages to the system (e.g., "Hello, how are you?", "What is your purpose?").
    *   **Expected Outcome**:
        1.  The `Ultra Orchestrator Agent` responds to each message contextually.
        2.  The agent remembers previous messages in the same session (e.g., if you ask "What was the first thing I said?", it should answer correctly).
        3.  The front-end successfully displays the back-and-forth conversation.

### **Build 2: Introducing the First Specialized Agent & Tool Use**

Now we introduce the concept of delegation. The Orchestrator will learn to recognize a specific task (research) and delegate it to a specialized agent who can use an external tool.

*   **Goal**: Enable the Orchestrator to delegate a research task to a `Research Agent`, which uses an external search API to find information and return it to the main flow.

*   **Components to Build/Refactor**:
    1.  **Ultra Orchestrator Agent (Upgraded)**:
        *   Add logic to its prompt/function-calling capabilities to recognize when a user's request requires external research (e.g., contains "what is," "find information about," etc.).
        *   This is the first implementation of "Autonomously determines which specialized agents... are required."
    2.  **Research Agent (Initial Version)**:
        *   Create a new agent function that takes a research query as input.
    3.  **External Search Service Integration**:
        *   Integrate a search tool like **Tavily** or **Exa**.
        *   The `Research Agent` will use this tool to execute the search.
    4.  **Research Graph (Initial Version)**:
        *   Create a simple, dedicated graph for the research process: `receive_query` -> `call_search_tool` -> `summarize_results`.
    5.  **Orchestrator Graph (Upgraded)**:
        *   Add a conditional edge. The graph will now decide: is this a simple chat message OR a research request?
        *   If it's a research request, the graph will invoke the `Research Graph`. The state will be passed and updated accordingly.

*   **End-to-End Test**:
    *   **Action**: Give the system a research-oriented prompt, like: **"I want a solution for my weak English. Can you research some popular language learning apps?"**
    *   **Expected Outcome**:
        1.  The Orchestrator identifies this as a research task.
        2.  It calls the `Research Agent`.
        3.  The `Research Agent` uses Tavily/Exa to search for "popular language learning apps".
        4.  The agent returns a summarized list of apps (e.g., Duolingo, Babbel, etc.) to the user.
        5.  The conversation can then continue (e.g., User: "Tell me more about Duolingo.").

### **Build 3: The Monitoring Agent & Verbose Front-End Feedback**

Transparency is key. This build focuses on making the system's internal actions visible to the user, fulfilling a core objective.

*   **Goal**: Provide a real-time, verbose log of agent actions and state transitions to the front-end.

*   **Components to Build/Refactor**:
    1.  **Monitoring Agent (as a State Logger)**:
        *   This "agent" won't be an LLM-powered entity initially. It will be a logging utility integrated into the graph state.
        *   Modify the main graph state object to include a `monitoring_log` (a list of strings).
    2.  **Refactor All Agent Nodes**:
        *   Update every node in both the `Orchestrator Graph` and `Research Graph`.
        *   Before executing its logic, each node must append a message to the `monitoring_log` (e.g., "`[Orchestrator]`: Delegating to Research Agent.").
        *   After execution, it can log the result (e.g., "`[Research Agent]`: Found 5 articles. Summarizing now.").
    3.  **Front-End Integration**:
        *   The front-end will need an endpoint to fetch or stream the contents of the `monitoring_log` from the current session's state.

*   **End-to-End Test**:
    *   **Action**: Repeat the test from **Build 2**: "Research popular language learning apps."
    *   **Expected Outcome**:
        1.  The chat interface shows the final summarized answer.
        2.  A separate panel or area on the front-end displays a running log in real-time:
            *   `[Orchestrator]: Identified research intent.`
            *   `[Orchestrator]: Invoking Research Graph.`
            *   `[Research Agent]: Received query: 'popular language learning apps'.`
            *   `[Research Agent]: Calling Tavily Search tool.`
            *   `[Research Agent]: Consolidating results.`
            *   `[Orchestrator]: Received summary from Research Agent. Formatting for user.`

### **Build 4: Architect Planner & Foundational Long-Term Memory**

Here we introduce the next step in the development lifecycle: planning. This also requires us to start building the persistent, multi-layered memory.

*   **Goal**: After research, have an `Architect Planner Agent` create a high-level plan (e.g., a PRD) and save it as an artifact in a structured, long-term memory system.

*   **Components to Build/Refactor**:
    1.  **Architect Planner Agent (Initial Version)**:
        *   Create a new agent responsible for taking research findings and a user goal, and synthesizing them into a structured document (e.g., a Markdown file).
    2.  **Project Architecture Graph (Initial Version)**:
        *   A new graph that takes research results as input and has nodes for `generate_prd` and `save_plan`.
    3.  **Long-Term Memory (Layers 1 & 2)**:
        *   Create a directory structure for your knowledge base (e.g., `./memory/`).
        *   **Layer 1 (Knowledge Synthesis)**: The `Research Agent` will now save its detailed consolidated reports as `.md` files in `./memory/layer1_research_docs/`.
        *   **Layer 2 (Build Conversation)**: The `Architect Planner Agent` will save its generated PRD into `./memory/layer2_build_artifacts/`.
    4.  **Orchestrator Graph (Upgraded)**:
        *   Add more complex conditional logic: `User Input` -> `Clarify/Research` -> `Propose Plan?` -> `Invoke Architect Graph`.

*   **End-to-End Test**:
    *   **Action**: Use the conversational flow from your example:
        1.  User: "I want a solution for my weak English. I'm a software developer and struggle with documentation."
        2.  Let the system perform research (from Build 2).
        3.  The Orchestrator should then ask: "Based on this research, would you like me to create a development plan for a tool to help you?"
        4.  User: "Yes."
    *   **Expected Outcome**:
        1.  The `Monitoring Agent` shows the `Architect Planner Agent` is activated.
        2.  The `Architect Planner Agent` generates a PRD document.
        3.  The system notifies the user: "I have created a Product Requirements Document for your review."
        4.  **Crucially**: You can verify that a `.md` file containing the PRD now exists in the `layer2_build_artifacts` directory, and the research report exists in the `layer1_research_docs` directory. The front-end should provide a link to download this artifact.

### **Build 5: The Development Team & Sandboxed Code Execution**

This is a major leap. We will now generate actual code based on the plan and run it in a secure environment.

*   **Goal**: Based on an approved plan, have the `Front-end`, `Back-end`, and `Coding` agents collaborate to produce a simple, runnable prototype within a sandboxed environment like E2B.

*   **Components to Build/Refactor**:
    1.  **Developer Agents (FE/BE)**: Create agent functions that can break down a PRD from the `Architect` into specific, actionable coding tasks (e.g., "Create a Flask server with one endpoint `/api/suggest`").
    2.  **Coding Agent (Executor)**: This agent doesn't plan; it just takes a precise task (e.g., a block of code to write to a file) and executes it.
    3.  **E2B Integration**: Set up the E2B SDK. The `Coding Agent` will use E2B to:
        *   Start a sandbox.
        *   Write files (e.g., `app.py`, `index.html`).
        *   Install dependencies (`pip install flask`).
        *   Run the application.
    4.  **Build Execution Graph**: Create a new graph to manage the build process. It will take the PRD as input and orchestrate the `FE/BE Developer Agents`, who in turn use the `Coding Agent` as a tool.
    5.  **Long-Term Memory (Layers 3 & 4)**:
        *   **Layer 3 (Codebase)**: The `Coding Agent` will save the generated code to `./memory/layer3_codebase/`.
        *   **Layer 4 (Dependencies)**: It will save `requirements.txt` to `./memory/layer4_dependencies/`.

*   **End-to-End Test**:
    *   **Action**: Continue from Build 4. After the PRD is generated, the user says: **"This plan looks good. Please build a simple prototype."**
    *   **Expected Outcome**:
        1.  The `Monitoring Agent` shows the `Build Execution Graph` and developer agents being activated.
        2.  It logs actions like: "Creating sandbox environment via E2B," "Writing `app.py`," "Installing Flask," "Starting server."
        3.  The system returns a URL from E2B that lets the user see and interact with the live, rendered prototype (e.g., a simple Streamlit/Flask page).
        4.  You can verify that the corresponding code and dependency files are saved in the LTM directories.

### **Subsequent Builds (To be detailed after the first 5 are stable)**

Once this core pipeline is functional, we can move on to the more advanced and nuanced features.

*   **Build 6: Full RAG and Memory Retrieval**: Upgrade the LTM from a simple file store to a fully indexed and vectorized knowledge base. Refactor agents to *retrieve* information (RAG) from memory before acting, enabling context from previous sessions.
*   **Build 7: Advanced Orchestrator Capabilities**: Implement multi-LLM fallbacks (Groq -> Gemini), anti-exploitation policies, and multimodal (vision) input for the Orchestrator.
*   **Build 8: Iterative Refinement & User Feedback Loop**: Implement the full back-and-forth interaction. A user should be able to say "Change the button color in the prototype to blue," and the system should be able to trace that back to the relevant agent and code file, make the change, and redeploy to E2B.
*   **Build 9: Dynamic Agent & Graph Creation**: The final, most advanced step. The `Ultra Orchestrator` analyzes a problem so novel that it designs and instantiates a new, temporary agent and graph on the fly to solve it.

This phased approach allows you to build and test incrementally, ensuring each layer of complexity is added to a stable foundation. I am ready to elaborate on any of these steps or begin with the technical specifications for **Build 1**.
