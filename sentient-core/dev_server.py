Development Server with Auto-Reload

This script runs the Sentient Core API with uvicorn's auto-reload functionality.
Note: There is a known issue where the server may hang during startup when reload=True
is enabled, particularly related to the SentenceTransformer model loading in the research router.

If the server hangs during startup:
1. Stop the process (Ctrl+C)
2. Use main.py instead (which runs without reload)
3. Manually restart the server when you make changes

Alternatively, you can try:
- Running with a smaller timeout
- Disabling specific routers temporarily
- Using external tools like nodemon to watch for file changes
