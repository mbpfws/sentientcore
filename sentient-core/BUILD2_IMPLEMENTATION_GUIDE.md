## Usage Examples

### Starting a New Session
```python
import requests

# Send message without session_id (creates new session)
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/chat/message/json",
    json={"message": "Hello, start a new conversation"}
)

session_id = response.json()["data"]["session_id"]
print(f"New session created: {session_id}")
```

### Continuing a Session
```python
# Continue with existing session
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/chat/message/json",
    json={
        "message": "Do you remember our previous conversation?",
        "session_id": session_id
    }
)
```

### Triggering Research
```python
# Research query (automatically detected)
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/chat/message/json",
    json={
        "message": "Please conduct a Deep Research on quantum computing advances in 2024",
        "research_mode": "deep",
        "session_id": session_id
    }
)
```

### Downloading Research Artifacts
```python
# List available artifacts
artifacts = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/chat/research/artifacts")

# Download specific artifact
filename = artifacts.json()["data"]["artifacts"][0]["filename"]
file_content = requests.get(f"http://localhost:8000/chat/download/research/{filename}")
```

   - Verify research delegation occurs
   - Check for generated artifacts
   - Download and verify artifact content

3. **Session Management Test**

## Migration from Build 1

### Automatic Migration
- Existing conversations are preserved
- New session IDs are automatically generated for legacy data
- No breaking changes to existing API contracts

### New Features Available
- Session persistence (opt-in via session_id parameter)
- Research delegation (automatic based on query content)
- Enhanced state management (transparent upgrade)
- New session management endpoints

## Performance Considerations

### Session Storage
- Sessions are stored as JSON files for simplicity
- Automatic cleanup of old sessions
- Configurable storage limits

### Research Artifacts
- Artifacts are generated asynchronously
- Configurable retention policies
- Efficient file serving with proper caching headers

### Memory Management
- Session state is loaded on-demand
- Automatic garbage collection of inactive sessions
- Optimized serialization for large conversation histories

## Security Features

### Session Security
- UUID-based session identifiers
- Session isolation and validation
- Automatic session expiration

### File Security
- Path traversal protection for artifact downloads
- File type validation
- Size limits on research artifacts

### API Security
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting considerations
- Error message sanitization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Session Not Found**
   - Verify session ID format (UUID)
   - Check session storage directory permissions
   - Ensure session hasn't expired

2. **Research Artifacts Missing**
   - Verify research_docs directory exists
   - Check file permissions
   - Ensure research agent is properly initialized

3. **State Persistence Failures**
   - Check disk space availability
   - Verify JSON serialization compatibility
   - Review session storage configuration

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging:
```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('sentient_core').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Database-backed session storage
- Advanced research artifact formats
- Session sharing and collaboration
- Enhanced analytics and reporting
- Multi-user session management

### Extension Points
- Custom research agent implementations
- Pluggable persistence backends
- Advanced session lifecycle management
- Integration with external knowledge bases
