Demonstration of Ultra Orchestrator Contextual Conversation Issue

This script demonstrates the current issue where the orchestrator is not properly
maintaining conversation context and building cumulative understanding across turns.

The user's requirement is that the orchestrator should:
1. Understand the ENTIRE conversation history
2. Connect each turn with previous turns
3. Build cumulative understanding
4. Only execute research when the COMBINATION of all turns provides sufficient information
5. NOT treat each message as unrelated
